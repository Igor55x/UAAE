# Features

There aren't many new features yet (I'm implementing basic UABE features for now).
There have been many requested features such as sprite importing/exporting, better command line support, batch import/export from gui, etc.
I don't have a lot of time, but I hope to get to them someday.

* Dump export/import in XML
* Options import/export all for assets files inside bundle
* Tabs
	* Dump view tab
